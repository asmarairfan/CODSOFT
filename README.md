Created a personal portfolio website using HTML5 and CSS3 for my internship @CODSOFT.

A personal portfolio website is a website that showcases an individual's work, skills, achievements, and personal brand. It serves as a digital portfolio or online resume, allowing individuals, such as artists, designers, developers, writers, photographers, and professionals from various fields, to display their work and provide information about themselves to potential clients, employers, or collaborators.

It solves multiple challenges for individuals by serving as a centralized hub for showcasing their work, building an online presence, and enhancing job prospects. It aids job seekers in standing out, enables freelancers to attract clients, and facilitates networking and collaboration. Additionally, it supports personal branding efforts, allows for creative expression, and provides a platform for tracking progress and archiving accomplishments, making it a valuable tool for personal and professional development.
