The repository contains the tasks I did for my internship @CODSOFT

Task 01: Personal Portfolio Website (HTML5 & CSS3)
This GitHub repository hosts my original personal portfolio website.
The primary objective of this project was to develop a unique and visually captivating personal portfolio website entirely from scratch. I leveraged modern web development technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3 to design and build this platform.

Task 02: Airbnb Landing Page Clone (HTML5 & CSS3)
This GitHub repository contains a faithful clone of the Airbnb.com landing page.
The project aims to replicate the visual aspects of Airbnb's landing page, showcasing the use of modern web development technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3. By meticulously recreating the layout, design, and interactivity of the original site, this project serves as a learning resource for front-end developers and designers interested in understanding and practicing web development techniques.
